# Car Website Backend System

Project repository for JavaND Project 2, where I implemented a Vehicles API using Java and Spring Boot that can communicate with separate location and pricing services.
I used these links below as instructions:
- [Vehicles API](vehicles-api/README.md)
- [Pricing Service](pricing-service/README.md)
- [Boogle Maps](boogle-maps/README.md)
- [Eureka Server](eureka-server/README.md)
